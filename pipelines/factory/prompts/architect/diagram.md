Read the feature blueprint just written and the current system diagrams under docs-internal/architecture/system-diagrams/.

Update only the diagrams that need changes:
- **entity-relationship-diagram.md**: Add new entities and relationships from the data model section
- **sequence-diagram.md**: Add new API flows from the API implementation section
- **system-architecture.md**: Add new components from the solution design section

Preserve all existing diagram content. Only add or modify what this feature requires. If no diagram changes are needed, leave them unchanged.
