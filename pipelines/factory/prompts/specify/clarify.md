Read all product context docs under docs-internal/product/ and all existing feature docs under docs-internal/product/features/.

The feature to specify: $goal

Analyze the feature idea against existing product context. Identify:
- Which personas this feature serves
- How it relates to existing features (dependencies, overlaps)
- Scope boundaries: what is in and what is out
- Edge cases and constraints from technical-requirements.md
- Open questions that need answers before writing requirements

Prepare a scope summary for the next step.
