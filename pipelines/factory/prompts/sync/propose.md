Based on the drift detected, propose specific changes to restore alignment.

For each mismatch:
- Identify which layer to update: prefer updating docs to match intentional code changes, prefer updating code to match intentional doc changes
- Write the exact changes: file path, what to add, modify, or remove
- Explain why this direction of sync was chosen

Group changes by layer (product docs, architecture docs, code) for review.
