Using the ingested artifacts, write the following product documents under docs-internal/product/:

1. **business-problem.md** — The problem this product solves, who it affects, why existing solutions fall short
2. **personas.md** — Target user types with goals, pain points, and usage patterns
3. **product-description.md** — What the product is, core value proposition, key capabilities
4. **current-state.md** — What exists today, what works, what doesn't
5. **success-metrics.md** — How we measure whether the product is succeeding
6. **technical-requirements.md** — Cross-cutting constraints: security, performance, integrations, compliance

Be specific and concrete. Where information is missing, state assumptions clearly. Every requirement must be testable.
