Based on the analysis, propose a concrete change manifest:

For each affected feature:
- **NEW:** Feature docs to create (product/features/ and architecture/features/) with a one-paragraph description
- **MODIFY:** Existing docs to update with specific changes described
- **REMOVE:** Features to deprecate or remove with cleanup plan
- **DIAGRAM:** System diagrams to update

Present the manifest as an ordered list of actions.
